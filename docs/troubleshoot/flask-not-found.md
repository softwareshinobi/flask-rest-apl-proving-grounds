ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask'

I'd be glad to help you with the `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask'` error in your Flask project.

**Explanation:**

This error indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `flask` module you're trying to import in your `main.py` script. This module is essential for working with Flask, a web framework for Python.

**Solutions:**

1. **Install Flask:**

   - Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory containing your `main.py` script.
   - Use the following command to install Flask:

     ```bash
     pip install flask
     ```

   This command will download and install the `flask` module from the Python Package Index (PyPI).

2. **Activate Virtual Environment (if applicable):**

   - If you're using a virtual environment, make sure it's activated before running the installation command. The specific commands to activate a virtual environment can vary based on your operating system and tool (e.g., `venv`, `virtualenv`, `conda`).

3. **Verify Installation Path (rare cases):**

   - In rare cases, if Flask was installed in a non-standard location, you might need to adjust your environment variables or use a tool like `virtualenv` to manage separate environments with isolated package installations. However, this is less likely the issue.

**Testing Your Installation:**

1. Once you've installed Flask, create or modify your `main.py` script with the following code:

   ```python
   from flask import Flask

   app = Flask(__name__)

   @app.route('/')
   def hello_world():
       return 'Hello, World!'

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run(debug=True)
   ```

2. Save the file and run it from your terminal:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. If the installation is successful, you should see output similar to:

   ```
   * Serving Flask app "main" (lazy loading)
   * Environment: development
   * Debug mode: on
   * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
   ```

4. Open a web browser and visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to see "Hello, World!" displayed, confirming successful Flask installation and usage.

**Additional Tips:**

- Consider using virtual environments to isolate project dependencies and avoid conflicts.
- If you encounter further issues, provide more details about your environment (operating system, Python version, IDE) for tailored assistance.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `ModuleNotFoundError` and start building your Flask application.
